# Introduction

According to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/?external_link=true), the organization behind Python, 
> Python is an interpreted, "object oriented", high level programming language with dynamic semantics.

Please note that as Python and its associated libraries is an extremely large subject that can be used to solve any computer science problem and takes many years to master. We shall remain focussed on concepts that are relevant in the context of data, machine learning and AI.

Now, let us unpack these terms one by one to understand what it means. However, before we do that, we need to dwell into the basics of how computers work!

# What is a computer and how does it work

We use computers everywhere - not just our laptop/desktop computers but we use them for everything from simple calculators to controlling timing on the microwave ovens, our refrigerators, our cars, sometimes even our homes, the mobile phones! Virtually everything around us use computers in some form and the fundamental question to ask is why is that so? 

The answer lies in some of these features of computers:

1. Computers can calculate very fast and with numbers of size that the human mind simply cannot deal with
2. Computers can do certin tasks repetitively  
3. Computers can also control certain devices based on these calculations 
4. Computers can generate data based on existing data using mathematical models

So what are the foundations of computer then? The answer lies in understanding a little bit of electronics. We will not dwell into a detailed exposition on electronics but just undertand it at a simple level:
