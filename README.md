Repository of Python Notebooks for children

The purpose of this repository is to capture a systematic approach in learning core Python concepts to solve basic problems using machine learning. The focus definitely is on thinking about Python and associated libraries as being part of tools eco system to solve real world problems using machine learning/AI. The problems in this repository and the code will focus on honing just enough skills in Python and associated libraries to be able to solve ML problems. Again the focus on Python as well as AI/ML is based on teaching these as tools to solve real world problems to 9th standard school children; All examples therefore are designed to deal with the approprate context and consequent levels of difficulty.

We intend to cover the following topics:

Core Python
- Concepts around data types, lists and strings
- Slicing, list comprehension

Introduction to Numpy
- Using numpy arrays including concepts like slicing, indexing
- converting Python lists to numpy arrays
- Concepts around reshape, join, split, sort filter

Introduction to Matplotlib
- Drawing different types of charts on two axes

Intrdouction to Pandas
- Concepts like time series data (Series), tabular data as dataframes(Dataframe)
- Reading data from different data sources
- Operations on dataframes and time series data such as search, join, convert to numpy etc..

Introduction to Scikit Learn
- Using the library to solve regression problems
- Using the library to solve classification problems

Introduction to Keras
- Using the library to solve computer vision problem
