Repository of Python Notebooks for children

The purpose of this repository is to capture a systematic approach in learning core Python concepts to solve basic problems using machine learning. The focus definitely is on thinking about Python and associated libraries as being part of tools eco system to solve real world problems using machine learning/AI. The problems in this repository and the code will focus on honing just enough skills in Python and associated libraries to be able to solve ML problems. Again the focus on Python as well as AI/ML is based on teaching these as tools to solve real world problems to 9th standard school children; All examples therefore are designed to deal with the approprate context and consequent levels of difficulty.

We intend to cover the following topics:
